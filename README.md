## Cypress Test Case Grouping
This guide explains how to group and execute Cypress test cases efficiently using spec file paths. 
Grouping test cases allows for targeted testing, reduces execution time, and simplifies maintenance. Below are steps to run specific test case groups both locally and in CI/CD.

# How to Group Test Cases
1. Pass the Spec File Path in the Script
In your terminal or CI/CD pipeline, use the --spec flag with a path to the desired test case group.

Example:
```
npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/smoke/*.cy.js'
This command runs all test cases in the smoke group.
```

2. Use npm Scripts in package.json
To make it more convenient and reusable, you can create npm scripts in your package.json file.

Example:

```
"scripts": {
  "smoke:test": "npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/smoke/*.cy.js'",
  "regression:test": "npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/regression/**'",
  "checkout:test": "npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/regression/checkout/*.cy.js'"
}
```
With these scripts, you can run specific groups using npm commands, like:

````
npm run smoke:test
````
This simplifies the command and makes it easy to remember.

3. Try Different Combinations
Experiment with different combinations based on your project structure and testing needs. Grouping helps tailor your test runs to specific scenarios, improving overall testing efficiency.

Conclusion
Grouping Cypress test cases is a powerful practice for managing, executing, and maintaining tests. Whether running locally or in CI/CD, adopting these practices can significantly enhance your testing workflow.

Feel free to explore various combinations and adapt them to your project's requirements. Happy testing!
